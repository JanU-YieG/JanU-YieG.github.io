## Original Data Types
- Scalar Types
    - Integer Types
        - `i8,u8,i16,u16,i32(default),u32,i64,u64,i128,u128,isize,usize`
        - liteger:`74u8,89_333,0xff,0o77,0b1111_0000,b'A'`
    - Floating-Point Types
        - `f32,f64(default)`
    - Boolean Type
        - `bool`
        - values:`true`,`false`
        - one byte in size
    - Character Type
        - `char`
        - 'üòª'
        - four bytes in size
- Compound Types
    - Tuple Type
        - (, , , , ),tup.1
        - different type elements
        - fixed length
    - Array Type
        - [, , , , ],[i32;5]=[ , , , , ],[3;5];a[0]
        - same type elements
        - fixed length
        - data allocated on the stack

## Functions
- fn function_name(params_name: type) -> return_type{}
- must declaring the type of each parameter
- Rust is an expression-based language.
- `Statements` are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
- `Expressions` evaluate to a resulting value.do not include ending semicolons.
- The return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body of a function.Also you can return early by using `return`.

## Control Flow
- `if` `else`,`else if`,`while`,`loop`,`for`
- `arms`
- break ...;

## Ownership
- Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory that are available to your code to use at runtime,but they are structured in different ways.
- `Stack`:adding data is called `pushing onto the stack`,and removing data is called `popping off the stack`.known,fixed size.
- `Heap`:allocating.unknown.pointer.
- `pointer` is a known,fixed size.store the pointer on the stack ,but when you want the actual data,you must follow the pointer.
- Ownership Rules
    - Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner.
    - There can only be one owner at a time.
    - When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
- `move`
- `clone`
- stack-only data:copy
- `Copy` trait
- `Drop` trait
- `References``&`
    - never have ownership---function parameters---->`Borrowing`
    - In a particular scope , you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.-->solved data race-->curly brackets can create a new scope.
    - References must always be valid.
    - A reference's scope starts from where it is introduced and continues through the last time that reference is used.
- `Dereferencing``*`
- `refer to` and `onw`
- `Slice Type`
    - have no ownership
    - Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a `collection` rather than the whole collection.
    - The slice data structure stores the starting position and the length of the slice,which correspondes to ending_index minus starting_index.

## Using Structs to Structure Related Data
- create custom types.
- `Shorthand`
- `tuple structs`--->tuple struct instances behave like tuples.(destructure,`.`)
- Each struct you define is its own type.
- `unit-like structs`--->behave similary to `()`.
- `Lifetimes` specify reference in struct.
- `derive` annotation can add useful behavior to our custom types.
- `method`
    - defined within the context of a struct(or an enum or a trait object),and their first parameter is always `self`.
    - `automatic referencing and dereferencing`
    - `Associated functions`:Don't take `self` as a parameter.Calling associated function use `::`.This function is namespaced by the struct.
    - Multiple `impl` Blocks

## Enums
- Enums can create custom types.
- Each variant can have diferent types and amounts of associated data.
- you can put any kind of data inside an enum variant.
- we can also define methods on enums like struct.

## Option enum
- enum defined by the standard library.
- a value could be something or it could be nothing.
- included in the prelude:you don't need to bring it into scope explicitly,you can use `Some` and `None` derectly without the `::` prefix.
- `Option<T>` enum is still just a regular enum,and `Some<T>` and `None` are still variants of type `Option<T>`
- `<T>` is a generic type parameter.
- useing `None` ,you need to tell Rust what type of `Option<T>` we have.

## Match
- allowed you to compare a value against a series of paterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches.
- Patterns:literal values,variable names,wildcards,many other things.
- `if` the expression needs to return a Boolean value,but the `Match` can be any type.
- each arm is an expression,and the resulting value of the expression in the matching arm is the value that gets returned for the entire `match` expression.
- If you want to run multiple lines of code in a match arm ,you can use curly brackets.
- Another useful feature of match arms is that they can bind to the parts of the values that match the pattern. 
- Matches are exhaustive.(we must exhaust every last possibility in order for the code to be valid).
- `if let`:If we care about only one of the cases and ignore the rest,we can use `if let` to avoid the match is wordy.You can use `else` after `if let`.

## The _ placeholder
1.match:the pattern `_` will match any value.

## Managing Growing Projects with Packages,Creates,and Modules  (Module system)
- Cargo provides Workspaces for very large projects of a set of interrelated packages that evolve together and contain multiple binary crates and optionally one library crate.
- You can not have two items with the same name in the same scope;tools are available to resolve name conflicts.
- Packages: A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
- Crates: A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
- Modules and use: Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
- Paths: A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module
- keywords:`pub`,`as`,`use`,`mod`,`crate`,`self`,`super`,`*`
- Mudules are not useful onlu for organizing your code.They alse define Rust's `privacy boundary`.
- Items in a parent module can‚Äôt use the private items inside child modules, but items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules.
- Rust chose to have the module system function this way so that hiding inner implementation details is the default. 
- `pub` to struct and enum:we use pub before a struct definition, we make the struct public, but the struct‚Äôs fields will still be private. We can make each field public or not on a case-by-case basis.In contrast, if we make an enum public, all of its variants are then public.
- `pub use`:Re-exporting
- `std` is also a crate that's external to our package,but we do not need to change `Cargo.toml` to include `std`,because the standard library is shipped with the Rust language.However,we do need to refer to refer to it with `use` to bring items from there into our package's scope.
- nested path: `use std::{cmp::Ordering,io}` `use std::io::{self,Write}`
- `*` the Glob operator:`use std::collections::*`
- The mod keyword declares modules, and Rust looks in a file with the same name as the module for the code that goes into that module.
- Module code is private by default, but you can make definitions public by
adding the pub keyword.

## Common Collections
- Rust's standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called `collections`.
- The data these collections point to is stored on the heap.
- A vector allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.
- A string is a collection of characters. We‚Äôve mentioned the String type previously, but in this chapter we‚Äôll talk about it in depth.
- A hash map allows you to associate a value with a particular key. It‚Äôs a particular implementation of the more general data structure called a map.

## Vec<T>
-  Vectors allow you to store more than one value in a single data structure that puts all the values next to each other in memory.
- Vectors can only store values of the same type.
- When we need to store elements of a different type in a vector ,we can define and use an enum!
## String
- Strings are implemented as a collection of bytes.
- every collection type has operetions:creating,updating,reading.
- Rust has only one string type in the core language,which is the string slice `str` that is usually seen in its borrowed for `&str`.
- The `String` type, which is provide by Rust's standard library rather than coded into the code language,is a growable,mutable,owned,UTF-8 encoded string type.
- strings are UTF-8 encoded.---->can not use index get char in a string.
- `+`:fn add(self,s:&str)->String{}
- format!:It does not take ownership of any of its parameters.
- you can use `string slice` to index a range getting a `string slice`.---->bytes.--not the best way.
- grapheme clusters:you can use `chars` methond,if you need to perform operations on individual Unicode scalar values.  `bytes` method:returns each raw byte, which might be appropriate for your domain.  But be sure to remember that valid Unicode scalar values may be made up of more than 1 byte.
## Hash Map
- all of the keys must have the same type, and all of the values must have the same type.
- A hasher is a type that implements the `BuildHasher` trait.
## Error Handling
- Rust requires you to acknowledge the possibility of an error and take some action before your code will compile.
- Rust groups errors into two major categories:`recoverable`(`Result<T,E>`) and `unrecoverable`(`panic!`) errors.
- `RUST_BACKTRACK`:environment variable to get backtrace of exactly what happened to cause the error.
- `unwrap` and `expect` methods on `Result<T,E>` type.
- `Propagating Errors`
- `?`:go through the `from` function,defined in the `From` trait.
- When you choose to return a Result value, you give the calling code options rather than making the decision for it.
- It‚Äôs advisable to have your code panic when it‚Äôs possible that your code could end up in a bad state. 
## Generic Types
- Avoid duplication by using generic types instead.
- Generics are abstract stand-ins for concrete types or other properties.
- `<T>`:you can use any identifier as a type parameter name.`<T,U>`.`<K,V,A>`...
- `Option<T>{Some(T),None}`,`Result<T,E>{Ok(T),Err(E)}`
- You can use as many generic type parameters in a definition as you want,but at this time ,it indicate that your code needs restructuring into smaller pieces.
- Rust accomplishes this by performing monomorphization of the code that is using generics at compile time.`Monomorphization` is the process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when compiled.
- `Function definitions`,`Struct definitions`,`Enum definitions`,`Method definitions`.
## Traits
- Defining shared behavior in an abstract way.We can use trait bounds to specify that a generic can be any type that has certain behavior.
- A `trait` tells the Rust compiler about functionality a particular type has and share with other types.
- Grouping method signatures together.
- `impl trait_name for type{}`
- `coherence`:One restriction to note with trait implementations is that we can implement a trait on a type only if either the trait or the type is local to our crate.
- `orphan rule`
- It can have default implementations.---->override--->Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait,even if those other methods don't have a default implementation.
- `impl Trait` syntax===>&impl Trait_name...--multiple->`+`:`(item:&(imple trait_name1+trait_name2))`
- `trait bound`:`pub fn notify<T:Summary>(item1:&T,item2:&T){}`--multiple->`+`:`pub fn notify<T:Summary+Display>(item:&T){}`
- `where` clauses:clearer trait bounds:
    ```
    fn some_fn<T,U>(t:&T,u:&T)->i32
        where T:Display+Clone,
              U:Clone+Debug
    {}
    ```
- Returning Types that implement traits:a value of some type that implements a trait.

## Lifetimes
- A variety of generics that give the compiler information about how references relate to each other.Lifetimes allow us to borrow values in many situation while still enabling the compiler to check that the references ar valid.
- Every reference in Rust has a `lifetime`,which is the scope for which that reference is valid.
- Avoid dangling references.
- `borrow checker` that compares scopes to determine whether all borrows are valid.
-  Just as functions can accept any type when the signature specifies a generic type parameter, functions can accept references with any lifetime by specifying a generic lifetime parameter.when we specify the lifetime parameters in this function signature, we‚Äôre not changing the lifetimes of any values passed in or returned. Rather, we‚Äôre specifying that the borrow checker should reject any values that don‚Äôt adhere to these constraints.When annotating lifetimes in functions, the annotations go in the function signature, not in the function body. 
- lifetime elision three ruls:
    - The first rule is that each parameter that is a reference gets its own lifetime parameter.
    - The second rule is if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters
    - The third rule is if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is &self or &mut self because this is a method, the lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. 
- One special lifetime we need to discuss is 'static, which means that this reference can live for the entire duration of the program. 

## Automated Tests
- typically perform three actions:
    - Set up any needed data or state.
    - Run the code you want to test.
    - Assert the result are what you expect.
